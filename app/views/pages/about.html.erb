        I graduated the University of Memphis with a Bachelors degree in Management Information Systems, in May of 2015. While obtaining that degree I developed skills in project management, analytical tools, SQL, and many other diverse abilities. While I was in college I started a small business where I used what I learned to develop a forecast methodology that based my previous inventory data and showed when was the best time to order product to minimize over/under spending during certain seasons.

I also use SQL to run various reports to find outliers that affects the company financially.
